## How to Use This Repository

### Class Content

You will find the following in [01-Class-Content](./01-Class-Content):


* In-class activities

* Weekly algorithms (where applicable)

* Supplemental content such as installation guides and learning resources

* Module Project code 

  This is the code for the projects that students build in their asynchronous modules in Canvas. You'll find the following in each `05-Module-Project` folder: 

  1. a `main` folder containing the final project build

  2. a `lesson-files` folder containing the snapshots of where the code should be at the end of each lesson in an asynchronous module of content

Use these materials to build your class repository.
